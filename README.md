# SustainaVerse
**Product Developed for CresCon 2024 Hackathon** 

# Project Title

This document provides user and developer insight into the Tree Carbon Absorption Estimation 
web application that will aid the administrate with visual display of their own land area for future 
planning with sustainable development utilising satellite imagery to detect trees within a specified 
area and estimates the potential carbon absorption of that tree cover.

## Description

Would allow the administrate to plan their future choices with sustainability, that will result in 
• Direction towards net zero carbon footprint 
• Increase Carbon absorption 
• Increase O2 production
Estimation will work on the criteria by segmenting image into major 3 parts:
• Total area covered by trees
• Total area covered by Buildings / Construction
• Total area that can be used for plantation
